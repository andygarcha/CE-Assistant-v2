# CE-Assistant (v2)
An object oriented version of [CE-Assistant](https://github.com/andykasen13/CE-Assistant), a discord bot coded using `discord.py`. This bot serves two main purposes for the online community [Challenge Enthusiasts](https://cedb.me).

### Challenge Enthusiasts
Challenge Enthusiasts is an online community made to curate and categorize video games in a point-based system. Each game is given certain "objectives" based on tasks to be completed in the game.

## Purpose 1: Game Updates
This bot will send detailed updates to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/spKdVZTZ6c) whenever a game on the site is added, updated, or removed.

When a game is updated, the bot gives a run down of everything that was changed.

When a game has a longer amount of objectives (seven or more), the bot will screenshot just the specific objective that was changed.

## Purpose 2: Casino
This bot allows users in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/spKdVZTZ6c) to participate in roll events. Users who participate in these will have a set number of games that fit certain parameters (difficulty, category, etc.) randomly selected for them, depending on the event. Once they complete these events (usually within a time limit, but some events go on forever), they're awarded a badge on the site, and the bot sends an update to the server.

The bot keeps track of all previously completed rolls as well, so anyone can view their previous accomplishments.

This gets a lot trickier, as some rolls are Co-Op or PvP. You can view a spreadsheet with all of the roll events [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jvYRLshEu65s15NKLNmVxUeTFh-y73Ftd1Quy2uLs3M/edit?usp=sharing).
